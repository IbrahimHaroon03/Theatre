# Software Development II Module Coursework : Theatre

### About
As part of this modules coursework I was assessed on creating a Java file with a Command Line Interface(CLI) based on a Theatre. This was coded on Apache Netbeans 13 as per the university's coursework specification.

### Files
The files Main.java contains the majority of code along with most of the methods and is where the file runs from. Person.java and ticket.java are seperate files which contain classes and objects which are then called upon in the main file for use. 

### Functions
The program had to be coded in a way to allow the user to do the following functions: 
1. Buy a ticket
2. Print seating area
3. Cancel ticket
4. List available seats
5. Save to file
6. Load from file
7. Print ticket information and total price
8. Sort tickets by price
9. Quit.
