# Software Development II Module Coursework : Theatre

### About
As part of my Software Development II module coursework we were assessed on creating a Java file with a Command Line Interface(CLI) based on a Theatre.

The program had to be coded in a way to allow the user to do the following functions: 
1. Buy a ticket
2. Print seating area
3. Cancel ticket
4. List available seats
5. Save to file
6. Load from file
7. Print ticket information and total price
8. Sort tickets by price
9. Quit.
